	<li>Go to <a href="http://docs.google.com" title="http://docs.google.com" target="_blank">http://docs.google.com</a>.</li>
	<li>Create a new Spreadsheet by clicking "New" then "Spreadsheet".</li>

	<li>As you type, the document is automatically saved, you can add or remove birthdays from this list at any time</li>
	<li>Next, copy the entire contents of your address bar. You should see something like: "http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=##########" (Where the #'s represent the unique ID of your spreadsheet.)</li>

	<li>Please <a href="mailto:birthdaygadget@gmail.com" title="birthdaygadget@gmail.com">send me an email</a> if you have any trouble getting the gadget to work correctly, I have tested it extensively, but I am sure there is something I could have missed.</li>

  <p class="title"><a name="anchor8">What happened to the Birthday Gadget?</a></p>
  <p>One of the biggest complaints I received about the previous version of the gadget was the limit on the number of birthdays stored in the gadget. So, in order to allow you to save more birthdays than before, and to keep your birthday data secure, your birthday information will be stored in Google documents. Using Google documents allows you to save as many birthdays as you want, while keeping the information safe within your Google account. An added benefit of this method is that you can now share birthday lists. See the Google documents help files for directions on how to share your documents.</p>
  <p>I received quite a bit of feedback about some problems with the previous version. So, I thought I would update it. I decided to take advantage of some of the resources provided by google.</p>
  
  <p class="title"><a name="anchor1">What does 'MMM DD', 'DD MMM', 'MM/DD', and 'DD/MM' mean?</a></p>
  <p>The 'M' stands for Month and the 'D' stands for Day. This option allows you to choose how the Birthday Gadget displays dates. The three M's in a row represent the 3-letter abbreviation for the month. The two M's in a row represent the number equivalent of the month (1-12).</p>
  
  <p class="title"><a name="anchor2">Why is the Age Column blank?</a></p>
  <p>The Age column is blank when the gadget is unable to find information for the year or when the date is in the future.</p>
  
  <p class="title"><a name="anchor3">How many different ways can I add a birthday?</a></p>
  <p>There are quite a few ways to add event details. For example:
  <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
    <li>Jan 1, 2001; New Year's Day 2001</li>
    <li>1/1; New Year's Day</li>
    <li>1999/1/1; New Year's Day 1999</li>
    <li>1/1/2999; New Year's Day 2999</li>
  </ul>
  Those are only a few examples of the format supported by the birthday gadget. However, each line must have a date portion and a name portion separated by a semi-colon.</p>
  
  <p class="title"><a name="anchor4">Why can't I add any more birthdays?</a></p>
  <p>Currently the number of birthdays saved is limited by how Google saves gadget settings. You are only allowed 1000 characters for all the birthdays. There are several solutions I am pursuing to allow you to save more event information; however, I do not want to compromise the securing of your birthday information.</p>
  
  <p class="title"><a name="anchor6">Can you translate this gadget into a different language?</a></p>
  <p>Yes, especially if you help with the translations. For most of the translations I used <a href="http://babelfish.altavista.com/" title="AltaVista - Babel Fish Translation">Babel Fish Translation</a>; however there have been a few people willing to help me out:
  <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
    <li>French: François D.</li>
    <li>Spanish: Elizabeth N.</li>
    <li>Italian: Leo</li>
    <li>German: Nico</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  
  <p class="title"><a name="anchor7">Can you fix the &lt;language&gt; translation?</a></p>
  <p>Yes! I would love to know that the translation in each language is accurate. Please <a href="mailto:birthdaygadget@gmail.com" title="birthdaygadget@gmail.com">send me an email</a> with the current text followed by the correction.</p>
  
  <p class="title"><a name="anchor5">Where can I send feedback?</a></p>
  <p>Thank you for your desire to help me improve this gadget. Feel free to <a href="mailto:birthdaygadget@gmail.com" title="birthdaygadget@gmail.com">send me an email</a></p>
