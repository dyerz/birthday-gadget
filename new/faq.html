	<li>Go to <a href="http://docs.google.com" title="http://docs.google.com" target="_blank">http://docs.google.com</a>.</li>
	<li>Create a new Spreadsheet by clicking "New" then "Spreadsheet".</li>
	<li>Save the Spreadsheet by clicking "Save" in the upper right of your screen.<br />Note: You may choose any name for this spreadsheet.</li>

	<li>As you type, the document is automatically saved, you can add or remove birthdays from this list at any time, and your gadget will be updated the next time it loads. (Or you can press the refresh button located in the upper right hand corner of the gadget.)</li>
	<li>Next, copy the entire contents of your address bar. You should see something like: "http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=##########" (Where the #'s represent the unique ID of your spreadsheet.)</li>
	<li>There are two places in the gadget you can paste the address.<br />If you haven't set up the gadget before, then you can paste it in the Gadget Setup view.<br />If you have already setup the gadget, then you can edit the settings of the gadget, and paste the address there.</li>
	<li>Once you click "Save" the gadget should display the birthdays.</li>

  <p>Please <a href="mailto:birthdaygadget@gmail.com" title="birthdaygadget@gmail.com">send me an email</a> if you have any trouble getting the gadget to work correctly, I have tested it extensively, but I am sure there is something I could have missed.</p>

  
  <p class="title"><a name="anchor8">What happened to the Birthday Gadget?</a></p>
  <p>One of the biggest complaints I received about the previous version of the gadget was the limit on the number of birthdays stored in the gadget. So, in order to allow you to save more birthdays than before, and to keep your birthday data secure, your birthday information will be stored in Google documents. Using Google documents allows you to save as many birthdays as you want, while keeping the information safe within your Google account. An added benefit of this method is that you can now share birthday lists. See the Google documents help files for directions on how to share your documents.</p>
  <p>I received quite a bit of feedback about some problems with the previous version. So, I thought I would update it. I decided to take advantage of some of the resources provided by google.</p>
  
  <p class="title"><a name="anchor1">What does 'MMM DD', 'DD MMM', 'MM/DD', and 'DD/MM' mean?</a></p>
  <p>The 'M' stands for Month and the 'D' stands for Day. This option allows you to choose how the Birthday Gadget displays dates. The three M's in a row represent the 3-letter abbreviation for the month. The two M's in a row represent the number equivalent of the month (1-12).</p>
  
  <p class="title"><a name="anchor6">Can you translate this gadget into a different language?</a></p>
  <p>Yes, especially if you help with the translations. For most of the translations I used <a href="http://babelfish.altavista.com/" title="AltaVista - Babel Fish Translation">Babel Fish Translation</a>; however there have been a few people willing to help me out:
  <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
    <li>French: François D.</li>
    <li>Spanish: Elizabeth N.</li>
    <li>Italian: Leo</li>
    <li>German: Nico</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  
  <p class="title"><a name="anchor7">Can you fix the &lt;language&gt; translation?</a></p>
  <p>Yes! I would love to know that the translation in each language is accurate. Please <a href="mailto:birthdaygadget@gmail.com" title="birthdaygadget@gmail.com">send me an email</a> with the current text followed by the correction.</p>
