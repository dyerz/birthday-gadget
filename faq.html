  <h2>Birthday Reminders</h2>
  <p>The Birthday Reminders gadget does more than help you remember important birthdays. It can also be used to help you remember holidays, celebrations, or any other event past, present or future. Below are answers to some questions that you may have.</p>

  <p class="title"><a name="anchor8">What happened to the Birthday Gadget?</a></p>
  <p>I received lots of good feedback from you about features of the gadget you would like added to changed, and I listened. Also, I have been using this gadget for a little while, and I wanted to make it easier. So, now you have a quick editing feature. This text box allows you to quickly add or change events in the gadget. A bonus feature of the quick edit is that you can copy the whole list of birthdays and save them to your computer so they are not lost if something happens to the gadget. I hope you find the new version considerably easier to use.</p>
  
  <p class="title"><a name="anchor1">What does 'MMM DD', 'DD MMM', 'MM/DD', and 'DD/MM' mean?</a></p>
  <p>The 'M' stands for Month and the 'D' stands for Day. This option allows you to choose how the Birthday Gadget displays dates. The three M's in a row represent the 3-letter abbreviation for the month. The two M's in a row represent the number equivalent of the month (1-12).</p>
  
  <p class="title"><a name="anchor2">Why is the Age Column blank?</a></p>
  <p>The Age column is blank when the gadget is unable to find information for the year or when the date is in the future.</p>
  
  <p class="title"><a name="anchor3">How many different ways can I add a birthday?</a></p>
  <p>There are quite a few ways to add event details. For example:
  <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
    <li>Jan 1, 2001; New Year's Day 2001</li>
    <li>1/1; New Year's Day</li>
    <li>1999/1/1; New Year's Day 1999</li>
    <li>1/1/2999; New Year's Day 2999</li>
  </ul>
  Those are only a few examples of the format supported by the birthday gadget. However, each line must have a date portion and a name portion separated by a semi-colon.</p>
  
  <p class="title"><a name="anchor4">Why can't I add any more birthdays?</a></p>
  <p>Currently the number of birthdays saved is limited by how Google saves gadget settings. You are only allowed 1000 characters for all the birthdays. There are several solutions I am pursuing to allow you to save more event information; however, I do not want to compromise the securing of your birthday information.</p>
  
  <p class="title"><a name="anchor6">Can you translate this gadget into a different language?</a></p>
  <p>Yes, especially if you help with the translations. For most of the translations I used <a href="http://babelfish.altavista.com/" title="AltaVista - Babel Fish Translation">Babel Fish Translation</a>; however there have been a few people willing to help me out:
  <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
    <li>French: François D.</li>
    <li>Spanish: Elizabeth N.</li>
    <li>Italian: Leo</li>
    <li>German: Nico</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  
  <p class="title"><a name="anchor7">Can you fix the &lt;language&gt; translation?</a></p>
  <p>Yes! I would love to know that the translation in each language is accurate. Please <a href="mailto:birthdaygadget@gmail.com" title="birthdaygadget@gmail.com">send me an email</a> with the current text followed by the correction.</p>
  
  <p class="title"><a name="anchor5">Where can I send feedback?</a></p>
  <p>Thank you for your desire to help me improve this gadget. Feel free to <a href="mailto:birthdaygadget@gmail.com" title="birthdaygadget@gmail.com">send me an email</a></p>
